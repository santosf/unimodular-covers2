Letter to referees
-----------------

We thank both referees again for their attentive reading and comments.

We have corrected all minor errors found by referee X, including "P7 l7,8: {q_2} and {q_1} appearing in T^+ and T^-, respectively, should be swapped. Right?" where the referee was absolutely right. 

AS for the comments of referee Y, we have also addressed all of them but some of them deserve an explanation:

3.	Page 7: I am confused by the two given triangulations. For example, consider \mathcal{T}^+ which has two maximal simplices S_1:=Cay(p,q) and S_2:=Cay(t,{q_2}). Now, by assumption, [\tilde{u},\tilde{q}_2] \subset S_2 crosses conv(\tilde{p}_1,\tilde{p}_2,\tilde{q}_1) \subset S_1. However, if S_1 and S_2 constitute the maximal cells of a triangulation they should intersect in a common face.

WE THINK THE REFEREE IS CONFUSED BY THE SAME TYPO NOTICED BY REFEREE X. "{q_2} and {q_1} appearing in T^+ and T^-, respectively, should be swapped". WE HAVE SWAPPED THEM AND HOPE THE TRIANGULATIONS ARE NOW CLERA.

4.	Page 8, second paragraph of Section 4: it would help the reader if the author(s) would include a few further guiding sentences explaining how to get to the configuration illustrated in Figure 4. For example, to show that f_q(p_2)=0 is not possible, one may use a proof by contradiction and use an appropriate shearing to get that in this case p+q \cong [0,1]^2. A similar argument (using a shearing), can be used to show that p_1 and p_2 have to be in the interior of the strip q + \langle \vec{p} \rangle.
WE HAVE ADDED AN EXPLANATION OF HOW TO COMPUTE THE VOLUME OF THE PARALLELOGRAM p+q TO SHOW WHY ONE OBTAINS A UNIMODULAR PARALLELOGRAM IF f_q(p_2)=0. 

5.	Page 8, line 16: you actually want that p_1 and p_2 are in the interior of the strip q + \langle \vec{p} \rangle. Maybe that formulation would improve the exposition?
YOU ARE RIGHT, THANKS! WE HAVE IN FACT REWRITTEN ALL THE INTRODUCTION OF SECTION 4 MAKING THAT FACT (AND THE WHOLE SETUP) MORE CLEAR.

6.	Page 9, last sentence in the proof of Claim 4.2: I think P being a weak Minkowski summand of Q doesn’t imply that Q must have edges parallel to r both in V_1 and V_2. For example, consider conv((0,0),(1,1),(2,1),(3,0)) and let P=Q. Then P is a weak Minkowski summand, but the statement isn’t true. Indeed, it is only needed that Q has an edge parallel to r in V_2. This easily follows by the fact that the normal fan of the Minkowski sum corresponds to the coarsest common refinement of the two normal fans.
TRUE; EDITED TO SAY THAT THERE MUST BE ONE EDGE PARALLEL TO r AND THAT IT MUST LIE IN V_2.

7.	Page 10, line -5: couldn’t it happen that r’ and r have different lengths (for example, when P=Q)?
WE CHANGED THE DEFINITION OF r'. WE DON'T NEED IT TO BE AN EDGE, JUST A PRIMITIVE SEGMENT LYING ON THE EDGE PARALLEL TO r. 

9.	Page 10, line -2 to page 11, line 2: it would help the reader if the authors would provide further details explaining why Q \cap p is strictly contained between the consecutive parallel lattice lines through p_1 and p_2 and through q_1 and q_1+q_2-p_1.
THE REFEREE HAS A POINT HERE. THAT "Q \cap p is strictly contained between ..." IS TRUE (AND CLEAR) WHEN q_1+q_2-p_1 IS "TO THE LEFT" OF p_2, BUT NOT NECESSARILY WHEN IT IS TO THE RIGHT. WE HAVE ADDED A NEW CLAIM TO GET A CONTRADICTION ALSO IN THIS SECOND CASE, SO THE "CONTRADICTION" PART OF THE PROOF NOW HAS TWO CASES

10.	Page 11, line 3: shouldn’t that be r’_2 instead of r_2? That is, shouldn’t it be g(r’_2) < g(s_2)?
THE REFEREE WAS RIGHT, BUT THIS PART HAS NOW BEEN CHANGED WITH THE NEW ARGUMENT.
