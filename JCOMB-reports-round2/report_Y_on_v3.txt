This report concerns Version 3 of the manuscript ‘Unimodular covers of 3-dimensional parallelepipeds and Cayley sums’. 

The mathematical content of the revised manuscript has remained unchanged, and therefore my assessment of the paper’s mathematical content remains the same as in my previous report: the results are significant, and publishing this paper would be of great merit to the combinatorics community.

The manuscript under review has undergone significant improvements in terms of its expository quality and now meets a high standard. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the authors for producing a beautiful paper. Nevertheless, there are a few minor points that could benefit from a minor revision. I hope the short list of comments below will make the finalization of the paper a swift process.

My recommendation to the editors is to accept the paper for publication in Combinatorial Theory after a very minor revision.

1.	Page 4, line 2: shouldn’t the center be (a/2,b/2,1)?
DONE

2.	Page 5, line 7: remove duplication of ‘the the’.
DONE

3.	Page 7: I am confused by the two given triangulations. For example, consider \mathcal{T}^+ which has two maximal simplices S_1:=Cay(p,q) and S_2:=Cay(t,{q_2}). Now, by assumption, [\tilde{u},\tilde{q}_2] \subset S_2 crosses conv(\tilde{p}_1,\tilde{p}_2,\tilde{q}_1) \subset S_1. However, if S_1 and S_2 constitute the maximal cells of a triangulation they should intersect in a common face.
WE GUESS THE REFEREE IS CONFUSED BY THE SAME TYPO NOTICED BY THE OTHER REFEREE. "{q_2} and {q_1} appearing in T^+ and T^-, respectively, should be swapped"

4.	Page 8, second paragraph of Section 4: it would help the reader if the author(s) would include a few further guiding sentences explaining how to get to the configuration illustrated in Figure 4. For example, to show that f_q(p_2)=0 is not possible, one may use a proof by contradiction and use an appropriate shearing to get that in this case p+q \cong [0,1]^2. A similar argument (using a shearing), can be used to show that p_1 and p_2 have to be in the interior of the strip q + \langle \vec{p} \rangle.
ADDED AN EXPLANATION OF HOW TO COMPUTE THE VOLUME OF THE PARALLELOGRAM p+q TO SHOW WHY ONE OBTAINS A UNIMODULAR PARALLELOGRAM IF f_q(p_2)=0. WE ALSO ADDED AT THE BEGINNING THAT WE ASSUME THAT THE SEGMENT p LIES INSIDE THE STRIP q + vec(p).

5.	Page 8, line 16: you actually want that p_1 and p_2 are in the interior of the strip q + \langle \vec{p} \rangle. Maybe that formulation would improve the exposition?
THANKS! YES, REFORMULATED THE FIRST PARAGRAPH TO EXPLAIN BETTER THE SETUP.

6.	Page 9, last sentence in the proof of Claim 4.2: I think P being a weak Minkowski summand of Q doesn’t imply that Q must have edges parallel to r both in V_1 and V_2. For example, consider conv((0,0),(1,1),(2,1),(3,0)) and let P=Q. Then P is a weak Minkowski summand, but the statement isn’t true. Indeed, it is only needed that Q has an edge parallel to r in V_2. This easily follows by the fact that the normal fan of the Minkowski sum corresponds to the coarsest common refinement of the two normal fans.
TRUE; EDITED TO SAY THAT THERE MUST BE ONE EDGE PARALLEL TO r AND THAT IT MUST LIE IN V_2.

7.	Page 10, line -5: couldn’t it happen that r’ and r have different lengths (for example, when P=Q)?
WE CHANGED THE DEFINITION OF r'. WE DON'T NEED IT TO BE AN EDGE, JUST A PRIMITIVE SEGMENT LYING ON THE EDGE PARALLEL TO r. 

8.	Page 10, line -3: remove ‘on d’. The line ‘d’ was used in the previous formulation of the proof but isn’t needed any more.
DONE

9.	Page 10, line -2 to page 11, line 2: it would help the reader if the authors would provide further details explaining why Q \cap p is strictly contained between the consecutive parallel lattice lines through p_1 and p_2 and through q_1 and q_1+q_2-p_1.
TO DO

10.	Page 11, line 3: shouldn’t that be r’_2 instead of r_2? That is, shouldn’t it be g(r’_2) < g(s_2)?
REF IS RIGHT, DONE.
